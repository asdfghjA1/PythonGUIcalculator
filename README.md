<h1>WHAT DOES THIS DOES??</h1>

oohK so just do " python3 main.py "

and if you seem to have some errors just do  " pip3 install -r requirement.txt  " 

so requirement.txt will install all the missing packages and then this should run perfectly 
so NOW YOU WILL HAVE A PACKAGE INSTALLED CALLED TKINTER 
 

 if you dont want to do the cool way you can just do :
 			pip3 install tk 

			so TK is an python GUI package that helps you make 
			gui things with python

<h3>ANYWAYS IF YOU DO  "pip3 install -r requirement.txt" it will do the same thing.....so</h3> 

<h1>------IF YOU ARE NOT INTRESTED AND YOU JUST WANT TO USE THIS -------------</h1>

open your terminal or the editor you use and then redirect to the directory you dowloaded this: 
		and first of all do : pip3 install -r requirement.txt
		and then you just have to do : python3 main.py
